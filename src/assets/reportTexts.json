      "In the investment world, evaluating the performance of a strategy is not just about looking at absolute returns. It is essential to consider how those returns compare to the risk taken. To do this, financial analysts use a variety of metrics to help measure the success of an investment in terms of risk-adjusted returns. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating investment performance, providing a clear view of how each contributes to a more complete understanding of risk and return.",
      "Here are the main performance and risk metrics that will help you evaluate the effectiveness of your investments:",
      "- Sharpe Ratio: This metric tells us if the investment is not giving a good return against the risk assumed.",
      "- Sortino Ratio: This is a more adjusted version of the Sharpe Ratio. It only takes into account the falls in the values of the investment. It is useful if you want to be conservative and are concerned about downside.",
      "- Alpha: Measures the extra return compared to what would be expected based on the given level of risk. If it is a positive value it means that the investment has outperformed the market.",
      "- Beta: Measures how the investment moves in relation to the market:",
      "     - Beta > 1: More volatile than the market.",
      "     - Beta = 1: Same as the market.",
      "     - Beta < 1: Less volatile than the market.",
      "- Information Ratio: Compares the additional returns of a strategy with respect to a benchmark index, relative to the volatility of those additional returns."
